This will later become the documentation of the packet.
As of now, it is just a collection of stuff.

The Header of a CMC packet consists of:
16 bit source id
16 bit destination id
8 bit type flag:

Sync packet
Finish packet
Error packet
Ack packet
Challenge packet
Response packet
Data packet

The magic numbers corresponing to these types may vary during development and may be specified later.

Specific packets have then specific payload attached to them:
Sync Packets have a 16 bit group id and a 160 bit public key in them
Finish and Error packets have a 16 bit option field, which will be used to specify error codes and finish states.
Challenge and Response packets have a 160 bit challenge or response message.
Ack packets have a 160 hmac or SHA1 hash as acknowledgement
Data packets have a 16 bit length field and then variable length of data.
