This will later become the documentation of the packet.
As of now, it is just a collection of stuff.

The Header of a CMC packet consists of:
16 bit source id
16 bit destination id
8 bit type flag:

Sync packet
Finish packet
Error packet
Ack packet
Challenge packet
Response packet
Data packet

The magic numbers corresponing to these types may vary during development and may be specified later.


A flag indicates, that this packet may have an option field attached to it.
The option fields are attachached in the following order and size:
Sync Packets have a 16 bit group id and a 160 bit public key in them
Finish and Error packets have a 16 bit option field, which will be used to specify error codes and finish states.
Challenge and Response packets have a 160 bit challenge or response message.

//Ack packets have a 160 hmac or SHA1 hash as acknowledgement
Ack packets have no extra data fields

Data packets have a 16 bit length field, then a 160 bit sha1 hash
and then variable length of data.

Get the basic network to work
Abstract the ECC stuff away from the user
