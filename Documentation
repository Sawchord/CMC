Events presented to the user:
connectDone: 
  Informs user, if connection was successfull, on Server also tells User the local_id

sendDone:
  Inform user, if message was send succesfully, and that sending more stuff is now possible



Commands presented to user:

Init [local_id, keys]:
  Sets local_id and the pointers to private and public key
  

Bind [client][group_id]:
Select socket to client
Are both STATES in CLOSED?
  no: error and return
  yes: set SYNC_STATE to LISTEN and COM_STATE to ESTABLISHED
       set group_id, generate masterkey, return
  
Connect [client][group_id, server_public_key]:
Select socket to client
Are both STATES in CLOSED?
  no: error and return
  yes: set COM_STATE to PRECONNECTION, set group_id, set server_public_key
       set retry_counter to 0, retry_timer, send SYNC packet, return

Send [client][destination, payload, plen]:
Select socket of client
Is COM_STATE in ESTABLISHED?
  no: error and return
Payload smaller than MAX_PAYLOAD
  no: error and return
Hash message, encrypt message and hash, fill in length field save and send
Was MCAST (address ffff)?
  no: Is Server?
      no: set COM_STATE to ACKPENDING1 and return
      yes: set COM_STATE to ACKPENDING2 and return
    
return

Close:
set COM_STATE to closed and return

Events to implement:
Init:
  Sets all STATES to CLOSED and return


Receive:
Any socket has matching group_id?
  no: return
Select that socket
Is it a SYNC packet:
  yes: Is this Server?:
         no: return
      encrypt masterkey with the ecc public key, 
      assemble KEY message containing master_key
      send message
return
Is it a KEY packet?
  yes: Is Server?
    yes: return
          Is COM_STATE in PRECONNECTION?
            no: return
            yes: set the packets src as server_id, the key as masterkey
                 change COM_STATE to ESTABLISHED
                 signal connectDone successfull to the user and return
Is it a DATA packet?
  yes: Is COM_STATE in ESTABLISHED?
       Decrypt the message, this updates the CipherContex
       Is this Server?
         yes: Resend the message set COM_STATE to ACKPENDING2
       Is this Node the destination?
         yes: Signal User the message, send out ACK and return
         no: Is this Server?
          yes: r
       Is this MCAST?
          yes: Signal User message and return
      
  Is COM_STATE in ACKPENDING1?  
    yes: Is Server?
      return
    no: compare last_message with recv msgs?
  Is COM_STATE i ACKPENDING2?
    yes:
  
    
Is it an ACK packet?
  yes:TODO
  
Timer:
Timer is already 0?
  yes: return
Update timer
Timer elapsed?
  no: return
  yes: decrease retry_counter
COM_STATE in ACKPENDING1:
  yes: Is server?
        no: return (should never happen)
        yes: retry_counter is 0?
             no: reset retry_timer, resent saved Packet
             yes: signal sendDone with error code, set COM_STATE to ESTABLISHED
COM_STATE in ACKPENDING2?
    yes: retry_counter is 0?
         yes: set COM_STATE to ESTABLISHED
         Last signal was addressed to this Node?
           yes: signal user sendDone with error code and return
           no: Is Server?
              yes: reset retry_timer , resend message and return
              no: reset retry_timer and return
COM_STATE in PRECONNECTION?
  yes: retry_counter is 0?
      no: reset timer, build new SYNC packet
      yes: signal connectDone with error code
return
